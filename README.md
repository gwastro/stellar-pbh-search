## Introduction ##

We present the first search for gravitational waves from the coalescence of stellar mass
and subsolar mass black holes with masses between 20 - 100 Msun and 0.01 - 1 Msun(10−10^3 MJ ), respectively. The observation of a single sub-solar mass black hole would establish the existence of primordial black holes and a possible component of dark matter. We search the ∼ 164 days of public LIGO
data from 2015-2017 when LIGO-Hanford and LIGO-Livingston were simultaneously observing.
We find no significant candidate gravitational-wave signals. Using this non-detection, we place
a 90% upper limit on the rate of 30 − 0.01 Msun and 30 − 0.1 Msun mergers at < 1.2 × 10^6
and < 1.6 × 10^4 Gpc^−3 yr^−1, respectively. If we consider binary formation through direct
gravitationalwave braking, this kind of merger would be exceedingly rare if only the lighter black hole were
primordial in origin (< 10^−4 Gpc^−3 yr^−1). If both black holes are primordial in origin, we constrain
the contribution of 1(0.1) Msun black holes to dark matter to < 3(0.3)%.



This is the associated data release for our search for sub-solar mass black holes merging with stellar-mass black holes. A preprint version of the paper
is [available on arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.03583). This release contains configuration files of the search, a top list of candidates, and the template bank used for the analysis.
